# π§π»βπ» Jay Prakash Narayan Reddy - The Dev π¦Έπ»ββοΈ

## π€ About Me

I'm Jay, a cool developer who's been coding for a couple of years now. It's been a wild ride, and I'm not slowing down anytime soon. Building clones and portfolio projects? Been there, done that. I'm all about writing code that pays off β whether it's stacking that cash π°π° or just having a blast π₯³.

## 🔥 Skills

I don't limit myself to any specific tech stack. At the end of the day, it's all just a tool to bring my ideas to life. I'm a quick learner and always down to try something new. Here are a few things I've been playing around with lately:

- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java
- **Frameworks/Libraries/DB:** React, Node.js, Django, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Tools:** Git

## 💸 Get in Touch

If you've got an idea that could use some  dev energy, hit me up! I'm always down to chat about potential collabs or just swap stories over a 🍻.
