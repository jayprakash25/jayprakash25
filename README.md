## ðŸ”¥ Skills

As an engineer, understanding fundamentals is key, and I've got that covered:

Here are some areas I've been hand's-on with lately.

- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java
- **Frameworks/Libraries/DB:** React, Node.js, Django, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Tools:** Git

### Open Source Contributions

Here are a few projects I've been involved with so far:

- **[JSON Schema Website](https://github.com/json-schema-org/website):** Added a dark theme to the website, making it easier on the eyes for all those late-night coding sessions.

I'm always on the lookout for new open-source projects to contribute to, so hit me up with recommendations!
