### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#  Jay - The Dev 

## About Me

A dev who's been coding for a couple of years now. Building clones and portfolio projects? Child's play. I write code that brings in cash or just lets me have a good time. Cool developer at the top of my game.

## ðŸ”¥ Skills

I don't limit myself to any specific tech stack - those are just tools to execute my ideas. I do well in core concepts that allow me to pick up any technology quickly. As an engineer, understanding fundamentals is key, and I've got that covered:

Here are some areas I've been hand's-on with lately.

- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java
- **Frameworks/Libraries/DB:** React, Node.js, Django, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Tools:** Git

### Open Source Contributions

I'm just starting my journey in the open-source world, but I'm super stoked about it! Contributing to open-source projects is not only a great way to learn and improve my skills, but it also allows me to give back to the developer community. Here are a few projects I've been involved with so far:

- **[JSON Schema Website](https://github.com/json-schema-org/website):** Added a dark theme to the website, making it easier on the eyes for all those late-night coding sessions.

I'm always on the lookout for new open-source projects to contribute to, so feel free to hit me up with recommendations!
