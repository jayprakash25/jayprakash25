### Hi there 👋

#  Jay Prakash Narayan Reddy - The Dev 

## About Me

I'm Jay, a cool developer who's been coding for a couple of years now. Building clones and portfolio projects? Been there, done that. I'm all about writing code that pays off whether it's stacking that cash💰 or just having a blast🥳.

## 🔥 Skills

I don't limit myself to any specific tech stack. At the end of the day, it's all just a tool to bring my ideas to life. I'm a quick learner and always down to try something new. Here are a few things I've been playing around with lately:

- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java
- **Frameworks/Libraries/DB:** React, Node.js, Django, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Tools:** Git

### Open Source Contributions

I'm just starting my journey in the open-source world, but I'm super stoked about it! Contributing to open-source projects is not only a great way to learn and improve my skills, but it also allows me to give back to the developer community. Here are a few projects I've been involved with so far:

- **[JSON Schema Website](https://github.com/json-schema-org/website):** Added a dark theme to the website, making it easier on the eyes for all those late-night coding sessions.

I'm always on the lookout for new open-source projects to contribute to, so feel free to hit me up with recommendations!
